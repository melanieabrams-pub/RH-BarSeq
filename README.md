# RH-BarSeq

Coming soon.

Pipeline for RH-seq with barcoding (Reciprocal hemizygosity analysis via sequencing, with barcoding)

The RH-seq v2 pipeline found here is modified from RH-seq pipeline from Weiss et al., 2018 (https://github.com/weiss19/rh-seq) with modifications from Abrams and Dubin, 2020 (https://github.com/melanieabrams-pub/thermotolerance-loci-across-yeasts) as described in the associated publications.
-first, count barcodes with the RBseq pipeline RBseq_Count Barcodes (v 1.1.4, https://github.com/stcoradetti/RBseq/tree/master/Old_Versions/1.1.4)
-then, either run the entire rh-seq analysis pipeline at once with the optional wrapper script, or one script at a time.
